## Caesar Cipher
📝 Description:
The Caesar cipher is an encryption technique.
The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter witht a different one, a fixed number of places down the alphabet.
![Example of the Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg)

🪄 Features:
I created a simple Ceasar Cipher code, to encode and decode a string with a given offset.
It also has a decoder for when you don't know the offset.
